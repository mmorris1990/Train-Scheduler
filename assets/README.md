# Train-Scheduler
---
A realtime app displaying information about multiple trains and their relevant information. Users can input new train data, which will be saved to the database and added to the schedule dynamically. Firebase storage is implemented to ensure the schedule can be accessed from multiple devices.

Javascript and Moment.js are used to calculate the current time, what time each train will arrive next, and how many minutes away they are.
